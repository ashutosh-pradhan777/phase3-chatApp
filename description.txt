Chat-App
=========
This is a chat application made using node,express,socket.io and mongodb.

The client side is made using a html page which contains the name
and message field.

A user can mention his name and send message which is then stored in
the database named 'chatapp'. The user's message is also shown below
the send button inside a div.

The database contains 2 parameters, i.e name and message.

Similarly, on the server side, after the post method is called,
"chat" event is triggered inside the client which then stores the
data and shows it on client interface.
